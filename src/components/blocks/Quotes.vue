          <p>
            When you look in the eyes of grace, when you meet grace,
            when you embrace grace, when you see the nail prints in
            graceâ€™s hands and the fire in his eyes, when you feel his
            relentless love for you - it will not motivate you to sin.
            It will motivate you to righteousness.

          For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in
          him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into
          the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be
          saved through him.

          There is a God-shaped vacuum in the heart of each man which cannot be satisfied
          by any created thing but only by God the Creator.
